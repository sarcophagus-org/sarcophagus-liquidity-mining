Sarcophagus is a decentralized dead man's switch built on Ethereum and Arweave.

## Overview
This repository contains the smart contracts and frontend code necessary for the operation of [SARCO Token Liquidity Mining](https://mining.sarcophagus.io). Liquidity Mining is the process of locking stablecoins into a contract for a period of time, forgoing the opportunity of time-value yield for those stablecoins in exchange for a proportional emission of SARCO tokens.

The SARCO liquidity mining contract is live on mainnet at [`0xf6ead7c9bc26b7641b7310eb7ef6c2040f16adef`](https://etherscan.io/address/0xf6ead7c9bc26b7641b7310eb7ef6c2040f16adef).

## Contract
The liquidity mining contract is a public litmus test to determine a course of action for the the future Sarcophagus [Aragon DAO](https://aragon.org/dao). One can think of the live metrics on the liquidity mining dashboard as a decentralized public [windsock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windsock) that participants in the Sarcophagus DAO can use to guide their approach path towards future issues and initiatives.

## Frontend
The frontend is a React app which reads and writes directly from and to the on-chain contract.
